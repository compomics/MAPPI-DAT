Title: Interface between Python and S language
Description: Allows Python programs to invoke S functions, methods, etc.
     and S code to call Python functionality. This uses a general foreign
     reference mechanism to avoid copying and translating object contents
     and definitions.
Depends: Python 1.5 or higher
