<h2>Get or set the R to Python foreign reference handler.</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The R-Python reference manager/handler is responsible for caching and
resolving R objects that are exported to Python as references to R
objects. The manager accepts these R objects and stores them with a
given unique name, and returns an object that identifies it. When the
object is used in Python, the reference is passed back to R and
resolved by this handler.  This handler is implemented as a collection
of basic R functions with different functions handling the storing and
resolving of references, calling functions on that reference.  Usually
this is a closure that shares access to the pool of objects being
exported.  These two functions allow one to get the currently
registered handler and also to set the handler.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
setPythonHandler(handler)
getPythonHandler(handler)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>handler</code></td>
<td>
the handler to be registered as the active one.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Currently, the form of the handler is quite restricted.
It should be a list with the same length and functions 
in the same order as those in the default handler
returned by <code><a href="../../RSPython/html/referenceManager.html">referenceManager</a></code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
Both functions return the reference handler that was registered
before the function was called. In the case of the
<code>setPythonHandler</code>, this is the value that is being replaced.</p>
