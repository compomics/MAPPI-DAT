_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This allows one to call a method of a Python object from R in a
     simple form such as `pyObj$method(arg1, arg2, ...)'. This provides
     an overloading of the `$' operator for R objects of class
     `PythonReference' to return a simplified call to `.PythonMethod'

_U_s_a_g_e:

     $.PythonReference(obj, name)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     obj: the `PythonReference' object whose method is to be called.

    name: the name of the method in the Python object which is to be
          called.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     When calling a Python object's method from R, one specifies the
     reference to the Python object and the name of the method along
     with the arguments to that method in a call to `.PythonMethod'. 
     This function/method returns  function object containing
     sufficient information to call the specified method on the given
     reference. These two pieces of information are stored in an R
     closure instance and this can then be called as a regular function
     whose body calls `.PythonMethod'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A function closure instance whose body consists of a call to
     `.PythonMethod' for the  specified `PythonReference' object and
     method name.
