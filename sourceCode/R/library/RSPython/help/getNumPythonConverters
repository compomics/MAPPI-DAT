     These functions allow the user to examine what C routines and R
     and Python functions are currently registered to implement the
     conversion between R and Python objects. These control how values
     in one system are converted to objects in the other system as they
     are transferred as arguments to functions in the foreign system
     and returned as results to the calling system. These functions
     give both the number  and descriptions of each of the converters
     registered in either direction (i.e., from R to Python and
     vice-versa.) The descriptions are usually specified by the
     registrant when the converters are registered.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     getNumPythonConverters(which=c(fromPython = F, toPython = T))
     getPythonConverterDescriptions(which=c(fromPython = F, toPython = T))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   which: the direction(s) of the conversion of interest, i.e.  from
          Python to R and/or from R to Python

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Converters are registered at the C level as pairs of C routines
     given by a matching routine that determines whether the converter
     is appropriate for the object to be converted and the  converter
     routine itself which performs the translation from one system to
     the other. Additionally,

_V_a_l_u_e:

     `getNumPythonConverters' returns an integer vector giving the
     number of converters in the list for each of the specified
     directions. `getPythonConverterDescriptions' returns a list with
     an element for each of the directions specified. Each element in
     this list is a character vector  containing the description string
     for each of the  different (match, converter) pairs.
