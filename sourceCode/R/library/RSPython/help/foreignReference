     This function creates a reference from an S object and optionally
     registers it with the foreign reference manager.  This reference
     can then be used to identify the S object  in a foreign system,
     passing it as either an argument in a function call to that
     foreign system or as the result of a call to an S function from
     that system. The reference can be given additional information
     such as a name by which to identify it, one or more target classes
     in the foreign system that it should  masquerade as.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     foreignReference(obj, id=NULL, className=NULL, targetClasses=NULL, register=T)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     obj: the S object which the new reference is to identify

      id: an optional name to use to identify this reference and value.
          This should be unique and if omitted will be generated by the
          reference manager so that it is unique. It can be specified
          here to provide a convenient way to  refer to an object and
          also to simplify garbage collection.

className: ?

targetClasses: the names of any classes in the foreign system  that
          this reference should ``implement'' when it is instantiated
          in this system. This is a way of controlling the conversion
          of the reference to an object in the foreign system.

register: a logical value indicating whether the reference and object
          should be registered with the current foreign reference
          manager. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An object of class  `NamedRReference' or `AnonymousRReference'
     depending on whether `id' is specified or not. The object contains
     the following fields 

      id: the name for the reference

   value: the object or value (`obj' in the call) associated with this
          reference

className: 

targetClasses: the value of `targetClasses' in the call

    type: the type of the object being referenced, computed by `typeof'

 classes: the class(es) of the object being referenced, computed by
          `class'
