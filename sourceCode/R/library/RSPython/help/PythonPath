_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function handles creating a suitable value for the
     `PYTHONPATH' environment variable which controls how the Python
     interpreter finds its modules.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     .PythonPath(path=NULL, merge=T)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    path: if specified, this should be a string specifying the
          directories in which to find Python modules. The directory
          names should be separated by the appropriate directory
          separator (":" on Unix). If this is missing, the current
          value fo  the `PYTHONPATH' environment variable is used.

   merge: a logical value indicating whether the basic elements needed
          to locate the Python modules used to implement this package
          should be appended to the value of the system variable
          `PYTHONPATH'

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The following is the algorithm used to determine the path. If
     there is no PYTHONPATH set, then we set our version so that one
     can find the RS modules.

     If there is a PYTHONPATH already set, then we take it and append
     our value to it. This can be inhibited by specifying `merge = F'

     Finally, if there is a non-null value for the path argument, then 
     we use that as the value for PYTHONPATH. Again, if merge = T, we 
     append the RS directories to it.

     If merge is T, then we take whatever value for path is given and
     append it to the current value of PYTHONPATH

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A string (i.e. character vector of length 1) giving the 
     appropriate setting for the `PYTHONPATH' environment variable.
